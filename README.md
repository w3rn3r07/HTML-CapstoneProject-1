# HTML-CapstoneProject-1
This project represents my first attempt at creating a portfolio website using only HTML. The goal of this project was to demonstrate an understanding of HTML by meeting specific project requirements and structuring the content of an online resume.

Project Requirements:
1. Create a head section that includes a title element with the text "My Resume"
2. Inside the body section, write HTML code to create an online resume covering the following aspects:
      i)Summary or objective statement
      ii)Education (list degrees, schools, and dates)
      iii)Work experience (list job titles, employers, dates, and responsibilities)
      iv)Skills (list relevant skills or areas of expertise)
      v)Awards, certifications, or other achievements (list any relevant awards, certifications, or other accomplishments)
3. Add a footer element with your name and any copyright information or other disclaimers.

To view the completed portfolio website, visit the GitHub Pages link:

In future versions of this project, I plan to:
1)Add CSS styling to enhance the appearance of the website.
2)Improve navigation by creating multi-page functionality for hobbies and contact details.
3)Include additional interactive elements using JavaScript.
